# Tkinter GUI Project

A collection of Python GUI applications built with Tkinter as part of learning GUI development.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`main.py`** - Main GUI application with label, button, and entry widgets
- **`mile_to_km_converter.py`** - Miles to kilometers converter with GUI
- **`Other_Tkinter_Widgets.py`** - Examples of various Tkinter widgets
- **`playground.py`** - Practice code and experiments

## 🚀 Features

### Main Application (`main.py`)
- Interactive GUI with labels, buttons, and text entry
- Click button to update label text with user input
- Grid layout management with padding
- Multiple buttons and entry fields

### Mile to KM Converter (`mile_to_km_converter.py`)
- Convert miles to kilometers
- Real-time conversion with user-friendly interface
- Input validation and error handling

### Widget Examples (`Other_Tkinter_Widgets.py`)
- Comprehensive examples of Tkinter widgets
- Demonstrates different widget types and their usage
- Educational resource for learning Tkinter

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
